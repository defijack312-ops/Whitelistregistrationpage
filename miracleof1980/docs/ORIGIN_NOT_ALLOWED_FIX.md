# 🔧 FIXING "Origin not allowed" Error

## ✅ What I Just Did:

1. **Added a big red banner** at the top of your page with:
   - The exact URL you need to add to Privy
   - A "Copy" button to copy the URL
   - A button to open Privy Dashboard directly
   - Step-by-step instructions

2. **Added console logging** - Check your browser console for the URL

## 🚀 How to Fix (2 Minutes):

The URL will look something like:

### Step 2: Open Privy Dashboard
Click **"Open Privy Dashboard"** button in the red banner, or go to:
